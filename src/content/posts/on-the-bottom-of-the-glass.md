{D}My radio started {A}playing \
{G}but I had to change the track \
that's the price that I'm paying \
for the things I can't take back

It was a good old cliché love song \
and it made me feel sad \
I was thinking about the things I had done wrong \
and why it all turned out so bad

**Ref.** {A}Why, why cannot {D}love ever be {G}easy? \
Why did I have to hurt you so much? \
Why did I break your heart into pieces? \
Why did I let my mind lose touch?

I was driving on a byway \
lamp posts were passing by \
it was a long and lonesome Friday \
more alone than meets the eye

I pulled over at the lousy bar \
and drank a bottle of gin \
and played a song on my guitar \
about the things that I have been \
through

**Ref.**

Bridge: {Em}Oh how, how {G}foolish of {D}me \
Oh how, how I wish I could see \
Oh how, how can I make myself clear \
Oh how, how I wish you were {A}here

**Ref.**

I put myself into bed \
and into the pillow I cried \
stayed awake and stayed sad \
all night

I'll have the last shot of rum \
to wash away the pain \
I reckon the time has come \
to hit the road again
